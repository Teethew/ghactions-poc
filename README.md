# GitHub Actions Proof of Concept

This is a CI/CD project to understand Github Actions

The project consists in a simple javascript file named `App.js` that imports and uses a object written in Typescript and bundled & minified with Webpack.
You can check the configuration used with webpack on `webpack.config.js`
